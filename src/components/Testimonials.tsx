        I've worked with many management panels over the years and Easypanel is
        so far the best one I've found. It's easy to set up and still gives you
        the option to configure apps manually if needed. The templates are all
        easy to use and the option to easily set up databases is wonderful!

        Easypanel comes as a breath of fresh air. I love that is simple to use
        yet powerful and the support is second to none.

        The aptly named Easypanel is in fact, super easy but more importantly,
        very effective. The use case potential for Easypanel is endless and
        greatly saves time and effort when spinning up new services or
        containers.

        I used many server management platforms, even paid ones. With Easypanel,
        my applications are connected with Github and I can deploy easily and
        reliably. It feels safe and comfortable to use this panel.

        It is very easy to use and makes life easier. Having a project on
        container or github and deploying it in seconds gives you great
        flexibility. I like to use EasyPanel

        Easypanel makes quick container deployments a breeze, I am able to
        concentrate on the development and push out new projects quicker - I am
        recommending Easypanel to everyone I meet in the dev world... Love this
        product!

# Payment Requests

Request a long-lasting payment request as an invoice.

## Detail

This feature allows users to create invoices that can last till anytime they are ready to make payments. It allows the funds paid through a payment request to use the exchange rate at the time of payment. Payments are made at payer's convenience without both parties having to negotiate exchange rates at the time of payment.

Users can pay the requests in a bit by bit payments. The payment request will remain valid until it is paid in full or if the store owner requires an expiration time. You may also need to know that Crypto Payment Addresses are never reused in this case. A new address is generated each time the payer clicks pay so as not to edit payment balances or details.

Using this feature, Lucre labels invoices as "payment requests" in your store's invoice list. Therefore, user can print invoice data or export it for record keeping based on labels.

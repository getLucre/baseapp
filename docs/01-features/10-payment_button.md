# Payment Button

Create a fixed amount for things and donations.

## Detail

Pay buttons are great when you have a fixed amount for a product or a donation. In fact, it is advised to be used for a scenario of donations. 

The feature is HTML embeddable so that you can copy it and put on your website for fixed-amount donations. When the customer or a visitor clicks on the button, Lucre displays a checkout page and an invoice for them.

Also, note that this feature is customisable for users to type in any amount and pay with the button.

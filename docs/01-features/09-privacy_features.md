Privacy enhancement and guaranteed anonymity.

## Detail

Lucre supports both PayJoins and Tor

### PayJoins (i.e. pay-to-end-point or P2EP)

Payjoin is a technique for paying someone while including one of their inputs in the payment in order to enhance the privacy of the spender. In a nutshell, it is a type of Bitcoin transaction to enhance privacy and guarantee anonymity of the participants. Thereby, improving Bitcoin's fungibility and your financial sovereignty!.

As a merchant on Lucre, you can enable Payjoin. More details on how-to in other subheadings.

### Tor

# Invoices 

Create invoices and get paid.

## Introduction

Lucre allows you to create and send invoices requesting payments for goods and services in crypto. That way, users can raise invoices and get paid, as well as refund if need arise. 

It is also important to note that; using this feature means that the payer has to make payment within a certain set timeframe you choose, as it will expire after the timeframe chosen. This is solely because the exchange rate is locked to that timespan chosen, given that crypto fluctuates a lot.

All payments made through Lucre are shown in the `invoice` page, except the transactions you receive manually with the non-custodial built-in wallet.
